# California Housing Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the California Housing Price Prediction project repository!

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict median housing prices in various districts of California. Using the well-known California Housing dataset, we explore a complete data science pipeline from data understanding to model deployment considerations.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict housing prices based on various features, demonstrating key machine learning concepts and techniques in a practical scenario.

## Repository Contents

* **[`housing_price_prediction.ipynb`](./housing_price_prediction.ipynb)**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation code. This is the core of the project.
* **[`blog.md`](./blog.md)**: A detailed blog post explaining the project in a more narrative format, summarizing the methodology, insights, and results. This is designed for easy reading and understanding of the project's highlights.


## Key Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and utilities (data splitting, preprocessing, model selection).
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
* **XGBoost**: For advanced gradient boosting.

## How to Explore

1.  **Read the Blog Post**: For a high-level overview and key takeaways, start with the [`blog.md`](./blog.md) file.
2.  **Dive into the Notebook**: For a detailed understanding of the code and step-by-step analysis, open the [`housing_price_prediction.ipynb`](./housing_price_prediction.ipynb) notebook. You can view it directly on GitHub or open it in a Jupyter environment.

Feel free to explore the code, replicate the analysis, and provide any feedback!
